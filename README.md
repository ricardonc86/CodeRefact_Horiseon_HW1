# CodeRefact_Horiseon_HW1

## The reorganization and simplfication of the website Horiseon code. 

The purpose of this project is to reorganize and simplfy the html & Css code for the Horiseon website. A easy to read and organized html & Css code can assist anyone going into the code for a faster and easy refactoring of the code. Providing comments within the code ensures fastering production times and easy understanding on what was changed, why it was changed, and what was taken out for others developers to better understand. 
By conducting this project i understand on why having semantic structure and having the code organized will not only help me in knowing where any issues are located but assist other developers in their search for any incorrect code. The project stands out for its organization and comments relayed throughout, a complete 360 from its previous form.
